# React Challenge

Build a web page that displays the content and matches the design below as close as possible. The page should be responsive, and should support common resolutions ranging from mobile to desktop.

Base URL - `https://ign-apis.herokuapp.com`

Article Feed Endpoint - `/articles`

Video Feed Endpoint - `/videos`

Comment Count Endpoint - `/comments?ids={comma seperated contentIds}`

This app should display the fetched content and match the general design below as close as possible. (Don’t worry about the icons.)

![design](./design.gif)

Each list item should open a webview for the corresponding content on ign.com when tapped (except comments).

Optional API Pagination Parameters:

- startIndex: The index of the first record to return in the response. Default is 0, min is 0, max is 300
- count: The number of records to return in the response. Default is 10, min is 1, max is 20.

Sample Paginated Request: `https://ign-apis.herokuapp.com/articles?startIndex=30&count=5`

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
